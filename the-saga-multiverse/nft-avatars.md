# NFT Avatars

Avatars are people from different realms of Sagaverse. These are NFTs owned by the players by staking their SAGA LP tokens. The players entering the game with the Avatar will be getting almost double the benefits that those who are entering without them. There are other use cases like participation in lotteries, avatar loans, avatar lending, etc.
