# GEM Token

### **Minting**

The game actions for minting have to be set in each game. For example, in the game Aqua Saga, the minting is done every time a user sells the fish in the market, wins a fish battle, and for daily rewards.



### **Burning**

Like the minting, the burning token game actions should also be set in a well-balanced way inside the game. For example, in Aqua Saga, token burning happens when the user breeds the fighter fish and hatches the fighter fish eggs.
