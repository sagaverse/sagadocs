# Supply & Demand

The SAGA tokens are minted every block and for every avatar minted in the platform a particular amount of the SAGA token from the SAGA LP tokens staked will be burned. The increase in the number of users of the platform makes the SAGA token deflationary, i.e., the more the number of users in the platform the more the number of tokens gets burned.

Now in the case of GEM tokens, the supply and demand are dependent on players and game actions. The games follow a chain of events driven by need and demand. For example, in the case of Aqua Saga, the users need to upgrade their boat and fishing rod for a better experience of fishing, breeding, and hatching of fighter fish and their eggs respectively, etc. For all these cases the in-game token, GEM, is used. Both the minting and the burning of the tokens are happening within the game itself and even the Sagaverse team does not have any control over it.
