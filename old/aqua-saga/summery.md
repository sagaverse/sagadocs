Aqua Saga is a play-to-earn blockchain-based fishing game on the Sagaverse platform. Enter into the water realm of the Sagaverse and earn by being a fisherman in the virtual world. Players can go fishing and sell the fish to earn GEM coins. They can do breeding and fish battles with the fighter fish they get/buy from the quest box/marketplace. Different levels of the game take the player to different features including quest boxes, fish breeding, and other splendid options to earn more.&#x20;

Aqua saga has the look and feel of a 2D game with visual screens of the lake and lobby where the players can get connected.
