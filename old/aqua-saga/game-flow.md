# Game Flow

#### MAIN LOBBY&#x20;

The player has to enter the main lobby when the game begins. In the main lobby, there will be three lake lobbies that connect to three different lakes named Saga Silver Lake, Saga Golden Lake, and Saga Platinum Lake. Each lake needs its respective entry tickets to enter. The players joining the game for the first time are rewarded with the Silver Ticket to enter the Saga Silver Lake. The other tickets have to be earned by playing and then purchased from the marketplace.

**SAGA SILVER LAKE AND LOBBY**

With the Silver ticket, the player can enter the lobby connecting the Saga Silver Lake. When you are entering the Silver lake, you can choose the Fishing spot that you want to join. You get to connect with these people in the lake before fishing. Every fishing spot will be having a limited capacity on a first-come-first-served basis.

#### FISHING&#x20;

The players can go fishing alone, also they can share their boat with other players who don’t own a boat. The sharing of boats will be available in the Saga Platinum Lake only. The upgraded boat owner can announce that they are willing to share the boat and they can choose the other player to fish with. They can fix the consensus of profit-sharing before accompanying the boat. So that they can go fishing together and they will be paying the boat owner a share of their earnings from selling the fish. The capacity of the boat to hold fish should be shared by the players in the boat. They can start conversations among themselves and this makes the game more interactive and fun. Every time the player fishes, a particular amount of energy based on the level of the rod used will be consumed. The player’s energy can be restored by either taking a rest for 12 hours or by consuming energy drinks bought from the market. When the energy drink is frequently bought, the price of the energy drink increases on each purchase. Players can opt for upgrading their boat and fish rod from the Marketplace to save more energy.

#### MARKET&#x20;

This is where the players can sell the fish they caught, upgrade the rod and boat that the player owns and buy the energy drinks to retain when the player is exhausted after the fishing. All the transactions in the market are done with the GEM tokens. The more the players fish, the more they earns the GEM token. And the necessity to upgrade the boat and rod will make the person hold the GEM token for a long.

#### PURCHASE GOLD TICKET

&#x20;Based on the criteria that the player should have made progress of at least Level 15 and have enough GEM tokens to spend for the ticket, the players can purchase the Gold Ticket from the Sagaverse Marketplace to enter the Saga Golden Lake. Players owning golden tickets can also fish in the Silver lake.

#### SAGA GOLDEN LAKE AND LOBBY&#x20;

With the Gold ticket purchased, the player can enter the Saga Golden Lake. Similar to the Silver lake lobby, here also the player gets to communicate with the people in the selected clan before fishing. Here, the player with a boat having a capacity of more than one can let other players share theirs.

#### GETTING QUEST BOXES&#x20;

Here also, the players can go fishing and sell them in the market to earn GEM tokens. Along with that, the players will get random Quest Boxes based on their level of progress. These Quest Boxes can also be sold in the Sagaverse marketplace without opening. Players get a fighter fish egg and random gifts when it is unlocked. The egg can either be sold in the Sagaverse marketplace or incubated to get the fighter fish. The unlocked Quest boxes and the items in them can also be sold in the market. They contain the Fighter Fish and the accessories they need during the battle.

Accessories include:&#x20;

* Fighter Teeth&#x20;
* Fin Armor&#x20;
* Spiked Tail
* Aqua Gun
* Dehydration Bullets&#x20;
* Different energy capsules

#### FIGHTER FISH BREEDING

&#x20;The fighter fish can be earned from the quest boxes directly or can either be bought from the Sagaverse marketplace that the other players have kept for selling. They can be bred with other fighter fish based on their sex and relationship to get a fighter fish egg. In order to breed the fighter fish, a certain amount of GEM and SAGA tokens has to be spent.

#### INCUBATORS&#x20;

When the player gets a fighter fish egg, it has to be hatched in the incubators by paying both SAGA and GEM tokens, and the hatching time of the eggs will depend on the rarity of the incubator.&#x20;

#### PURCHASE PLATINUM TICKET&#x20;

Based on the criteria that the player should have made progress of at least Level 30 and have enough GEM tokens to spend for the ticket, the players can purchase the Platinum Ticket from the Sagaverse Marketplace to enter the Saga Platinum Lake. The Platinum ticket owner can enter the Golden and Silver lake as well.&#x20;

#### SAGA PLATINUM LAKE&#x20;

Just like the other two, with the Platinum ticket purchased, the player can enter the lobby connecting the Saga Platinum Lake. Similar to the other lake, here also the player gets to express their feedback with the people in the selected clan before fishing.&#x20;

#### BATTLE ARENA&#x20;

Battle Arena is where the players will get to battle with the fighter fish they own.&#x20;

#### WINS THE BATTLE&#x20;

The player who wins the battle will be rewarded with the GEM tokens. Also, the players entered with an avatar will get leveled up which makes them earn more SAGA tokens as minting rewards.&#x20;

#### LOSES THE BATTLE&#x20;

The player who loses the battle will not be getting any reward. Also, it will affect the player’s avatar’s skill level which in turn depreciates the reward they earn in minting rewards of SAGA token.
