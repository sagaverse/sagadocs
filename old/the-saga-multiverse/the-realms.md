# The Realms

The multiverse of SAGA comprises six realms, named Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, and Quantum. Each realm has its unique power of energy and is protected by its guardians with their powers. In the Sagaverse Gaming platform, each game is a story from each realm, like, Aqua Saga is from the Water Realm.

In Sagaverse, the players entering with their avatars aim to play different games from these realms and earn to survive. These realms have a player-owned economy where the players can generate and burn the tokens from inside the game by playing.
