# The Guardians

The six realms of Sagaverse are protected by their powerful guardians with their unique set of powers. They are the rulers and decision-makers of Sagaverse.

During the initial SAGA LP stake, 100 Guardians will be distributed among the first 100 people with the highest stake. After that, a minting event will be conducted where everyone gets a chance to mint a limited number of Guardians of Sagaverse NFTs. The Guardians NFTs permit the holders to take part in the governance of Sagaverse.

There will be different sets of Guardians of Sagaverse NFTs with varying levels of rarity depending on which the Governance power is calculated. Anyone who holds a Guardian NFT gets the right to vote on longer-term governance decisions put forward by the SagaVerse team. Active Guardians holders are the ones who get lots of benefits and incentives from the platform.
