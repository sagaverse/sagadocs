# Avatar

### **Need of Avatar**

Avatars are also NFTs minted from the Sagaverse platform by staking the SAGA LP tokens in the platform, thus the avatars are holding a collateral value. Like how the Guardians play their role in governance, the avatars play a major role in the games. A Sagaverse user can take part in the games with or without the avatars. But the avatars bring a huge difference in the in-game action prices and rewards. If the player wants to enjoy the real benefits from the game, then holding the avatar will be the right choice.
