# Price Determination

One of the most exciting aspects of Sagaverse is that price action is different for both SAGA and GEM tokens. For SAGA tokens, it is entirely dependent on the number of users in the platform and how active they are in the community. Whereas, for GEM tokens, it is entirely dependent on the in-game activities, giving the players total control over the shape of the economy. Sagaverse creators have no control over GEMâ€™s pricing.
