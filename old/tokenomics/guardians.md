# Guardians

### **Governance**

Holding the Guardiansâ€™ NFTs not only means that the users hold them but also means that they get multiple incentives from the platform. These Guardians are playing a major role in the governance of the platform. The governance decisions are taken by voting with the DPoS consensus algorithm.

### **Incentives**

The incentives that the Guardians earn are not just limited to the minting rewards they earn **on** the platform. They get a part of the platform fee also.
