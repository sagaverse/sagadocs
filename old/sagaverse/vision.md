The NFTs, the Metaverse and GameFi are taking the crypto world by storm. As per the statistics, about 3.25 billion people around the world play video games, and around 50 million of them are Blockchain game players. That means there is a lot of untapped potential user base GameFi can extract from the traditional gamers.

Our vision is to create a gateway that would serve as one stop destination for crypto gamers, investors as well as traditional gamers alike. Sagaverse will be creating a multiverse of games where people can come, socialize, play games and earn rewards. The key point here is that the Sagaverse has a low entry barrier, just by owning one Avatar users can start playing all games inside the platform.
