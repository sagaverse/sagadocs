# An introduction to P2E

Today, the global gaming industry is valued at $170 billion and is projected to grow 10% every year. Even though the sector was having unbelievable growth, the gamers were not incentivized on their journey. Yes, there is the thrill of gaming but the ones who reap the rewards are the companies running these games. The flow of cash is unidirectional in these types of games and only a small amount of players can monetize their time spent in the ecosystem through streaming or some tournaments.

The year 2020 was life-changing for many, some people lost their job, some people left their job to go full-time in play to earn games. Play to Earn games widely known as P2E games are the type of games where any participants can earn while spending their time and effort in the game. This enables gamers to earn from what they love to do. Users will be incentivized with in-house tokens which will derive their value from the game itself.

A Play to Earn game can only sustain if they have a proper roadmap, the right economics, and most importantly an experienced team, this is where Sagaverse Games excels**.**
