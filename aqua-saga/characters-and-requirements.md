# Characters and Requirements

### Characters&#x20;

The characters are the NFT avatars in the Sagaverse Platform. The player can enter the game with or without the Sagaverse avatar. If the player has an avatar to enter the game, then you will be getting the minting rewards of the GEM tokens based on your skill level. Or else, you will be given a default avatar in which case, you wonâ€™t be getting the minting rewards. Every avatar will have a constant energy level value of 30 in the game to go fishing. If the energy goes down, either the player has to give a relaxation time of 12 hours or else can get the energy drinks from the market to drink and continue fishing.&#x20;

### Requirements&#x20;

* A boat - Every boat has a fish and person capacity which can be increased by the boat upgrade.&#x20;
* A rod - Every rod has a limit to the weight of the fish it can hold and the energy it consumes of the player to get a fish, both can be increased by upgrading the rod. These requirements for going fishing are given as an airdrop for the whitelisted SAGA holders and these can be resold on the Sagaverse marketplace for other users to buy. Also, they can be upgraded by paying using the GEM tokens. Based on the upgrade level their demand increases. The upgraded boat owners get more tokens by sharing their boats. The boat and fish rod can be given for rent so that even when the owner is not playing the game they can have earnings.
